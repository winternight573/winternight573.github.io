  This file defines the structure for my Melodious Meadow page.
  It is linked to my styling file styles.css and scripting file index.js.
  Aside from the header and footer, in the main part, there are
  sections for audios that can be played.
  The first audio section includes music, the secone for sound effects,
  and the last section is empty, as it will be filled through JavaScript.

  As for music, aside from the first song which was from https://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music
